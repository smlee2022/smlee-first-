Unintended methane releases could upend global efforts to curb climate change. That’s the conclusion of a just-released United Nations report and it’s why the U.S. Senate just thwarted a plan by the previous administration to ease methane restrictions. Indeed, the UN’s goal is to cut those heat-trapping emissions by 45% by 2030 using promising technologies.

The movement to regulate methane releases is supported among major oil and gas producers that have already invested in mitigation efforts. Moreover, companies like Shell, Equinor, BP, Total, Statoil and EQT are thinking long term: without methane controls, the world can’t limit temperature increases, which then dampens the prospects for natural gas usage; methane is a byproduct of natural gas that, if captured from leaking pipelines and new wells, can be resold.

“Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years and complements necessary efforts to reduce carbon dioxide,” says Inger Andersen, executive director of United Nations Environment Program. She adds that international cooperation is an absolute.
